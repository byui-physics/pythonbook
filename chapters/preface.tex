\chapter*{Preface}

This is a tutorial to help you get started in Python. Examples of
Python code in this book are in typewriter font {\tt like
this}. As you read through the text, type and execute in Python all
of the examples. Longer sections of code
are set off and named.  

This booklet can also be used as a reference manual because it is
short, it has lots of examples, and it has a table of contents and
an index. It is almost true that the basics of Python are in
chapters~\ref{chap:RunningMatlab}-\ref{chap:MakeOwnFunctions} while
physics applications are in
chapters~\ref{chap:LinAlg}-\ref{chap:FFT}. Please tell us about
mistakes and make suggestions to improve the text
(nelsonla@byui.edu).
