\chapter*{Preface}

This is a tutorial to help you get started in Matlab. Examples of
Matlab code in this pamphlet are in typewriter font {\tt like
this}. As you read through the text, type and execute in Matlab all
of the examples, either at the $\gg$ command line prompt or in a
test program you make called {\tt test.m}. Longer sections of code
are set off and named.  This code can be found as files on the
Physics 330 web page at
\href{http://www.physics.byu.edu/Courses/Computational/phys330.aspx}{physics.byu.edu/Courses/Computational}.

This booklet can also be used as a reference manual because it is
short, it has lots of examples, and it has a table of contents and
an index. It is almost true that the basics of Matlab are in
chapters~\ref{chap:RunningMatlab}-\ref{chap:MakeOwnFunctions} while
physics applications are in
chapters~\ref{chap:LinAlg}-\ref{chap:FFT}. Please tell us about
mistakes and make suggestions to improve the text
(michael\_ware@byu.edu).

To find more details see the very helpful book {\it Mastering
MATLAB 7} by Duane Hanselman and Bruce Littlefield.
