function g=indefint(y,dx)

% returns the indefinite integral of the function
% represented by the array y.  y(1) is assumed to
% be y(a), the function value at the lower limit of the
% integration.  The function values are assumed to be
% values at the edges of the subintervals rather than
% the midpoint values.  Hence, we have to use the
% trapezoid rule instead of the midpoint rule:
%
% integral(y(x)) from x to x+dx is (y(x)+y(x+dx))/2*dx

% The answer is returned as an array of values defined
% at the same points as y

% the first value of g(x) is zero because at this first value
% x is at the lower limit so the integral is zero

g(1)=0;

N=length(y);

% step across each subinterval and use the trapezoid area
% rule to find each successive addition to the indefinite
% integral

for n=2:N

   % Trapezoid rule
   g(n)=g(n-1)+(y(n-1)+y(n))*.5*dx;
